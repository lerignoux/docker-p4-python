# docker-p4-python
Container with both python and perforce  

Prefer using the container `lerignoux/p4-python` instead of `lerignoux/docker-p4-python` Hopefully we can remove it one day.  

## tldr:
Setup your env variables with server information  


## Env variables:
P4PORT: the perforce server  
p4USER: the perforce user  
P4PASSWD: the perforce password  


## Realeases
releases are following sematic versioning based on p4 release.
For instance p4 19.2 release will trigger container versions 19.2.X
